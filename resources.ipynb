    "> Note: Many of these notebooks are several years old and should be used more for inspiration rather than exact syntax. Since many open source libraries change rapidly (especially when they are in their first few years of development), some syntax may be different in the latest versions, older features may be deprecated, and relevant new features may be available which didn't exist yet when an older notebook or tutorial was written. \n",
    "> - For example, most of the earth science / geospatial example notebooks in this gallery use an older library called Basemap, which is now being phased out and replaced with the Cartopy library.\n",
